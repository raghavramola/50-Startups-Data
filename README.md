# 50-Startups-Data
This repo contains data of 50 startups situated in New york ,florida and california and how much R&D , administration etc is spend on them and based on this knowledge , I've build a model which will help us to show that what all features are needed to make a successfull startup (what should be R&D spent , administration spent , which location will be suitable etc).
